### 4. TODO

+ ☑ After closing current file open in Sublime Text file with last creation date — last file, create by GraceSplitter.
+ ☐ [Feature] [**GSplit**](https://www.gdgsoft.com/gsplit/help/TechnicalDoc.htm) support.
+ ☐ [Bug] Split command output to package folder, not file folder. If I run command in terminal, I get normal behavior. For other commands I also get normal behavior.
