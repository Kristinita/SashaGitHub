# write good [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/btford/write-good.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/btford/write-good)

Naive linter for English prose for developers who can't write good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too.


## Use

```shell
npm install write-good
```

**Important:** Do not use this tool to be a jerk to other people about their writing.


## API

`writeGood` is a function that takes a string and returns an array of suggestions.

```javascript
var writeGood = require('write-good');

var suggestions = writeGood('So the cat was stolen.');

// suggestions:
//
// [{
//   suggestion: "omit 'So' from the beginning of sentences",
//   index: 0, offset: 2
// }, {
//   suggestion: "'was stolen' is passive voice",
//   index: 11, offset: 10
// }]
```

`writeGood` takes an optional second argument that allows you to disable certain checks.

You can disable checking for passive voice like this:

```javascript
var writeGood = require('write-good');

var suggestions = writeGood('So the cat was stolen', { passive: false});
// suggestions: []
```


## CLI

You can use `write-good` as a command-line tool by installing it globally:

```shell
npm install -g write-good
```

`write-good` takes a [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) and prints suggestions to stdout:

```shell
$ write-good *.md

In README.md
=============
 = writeGood('So the cat was stolen.');
                         ^^^^^^^^^^
"was stolen" is passive voice on line 20 at column 40
-------------
//   suggestion: "'was stolen' is passive voice",
                   ^^^^^^^^^^
"was stolen" is passive voice on line 28 at column 19
```

You can run just specific checks like this:

```shell
write-good *.md --weasel --so
```

Or exclude checks like this:

```shell
write-good *.md --no-passive
```
